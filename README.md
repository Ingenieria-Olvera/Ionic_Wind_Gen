# Ionic_Wind_Gen

I have always loved space, and I have always loved high voltage. Why not combine the two, ioinc wind thursters are the basis for new space travel which is why I decided to make a mini version of my own.

##**WARNING**
I am not a professional yet I take extreme caution whenever I do and I admit to my mistakes, I was burning electrical tape making PVC which is lethal. Please research everything you can before attempting what I do.

###**GOALS**
- **Power**: I want it to be able to blow itself along with a small ship or zeplin to show that it can truly generate power.
- **Easy**: I want this to be able to be relativly simple to make and or desgin.
- **Modular**: I want to be able to potentially add on from my desgin to create an even better ioinc wind generator.


###**Components**
- **3-9volt power supply**: You can use which every you will just have to change the spacing between the negative prong and positive one to minimize arcing and maximize chorona discharge.
- **Transformer**: You need a lot of voltage for this project, making a transformer necessary, I will link mine [here.]()
- **3d printer**: I use 3d prints to house my components.
- **Graphite Paint**: I use graphite paint to make my things conductive, I recommend you electroplate with copper. I just dont have the ability to.
- **Wire Cutters**: Please cut each wire to your prefered length, this will save you much headache.


###**Versions**
- **V1**: V1 was by far the worst out of everything, I thought I could loosley make this without much thought, yet I was severly humbled and was instantly forced to make a new position. It was made out of cut cardboard, aluminum foil, and electrical tape, and prayers.
- **V2**:
