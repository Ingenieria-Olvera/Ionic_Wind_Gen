# Ionic Wind Gen

I have always loved space, and I have always loved high voltage. Why not combine the two, ioinc wind thursters are the basis for new space travel which is why I decided to make a mini version of my own.

## **WARNING**
I am not a professional yet I take extreme caution whenever I do and I admit to my mistakes, I was burning electrical tape making PVC which is lethal. Please research everything you can before attempting what I do.

### **GOALS**
- **Power**: I want it to be able to blow itself along with a small ship or zeplin to show that it can truly generate power.
- **Easy**: I want this to be able to be relativly simple to make and or desgin.
- **Modular**: I want to be able to potentially add on from my desgin to create an even better ioinc wind generator.


### **Components**
- **3-9volt power supply**: You can use which every you will just have to change the spacing between the negative prong and positive one to minimize arcing and maximize chorona discharge.
- **Transformer**: You need a lot of voltage for this project, making a transformer necessary, I will link mine [here.](https://www.amazon.com/DEVMO-400000V-Step-up-High-Voltage-Generator/dp/B07T3XDMH8?pd_rd_w=AB0ob&content-id=amzn1.sym.55f2405b-2aa3-4fa1-95e2-48a0da8f4e9a&pf_rd_p=55f2405b-2aa3-4fa1-95e2-48a0da8f4e9a&pf_rd_r=GYSF079SXB10VJ5NSB7Z&pd_rd_wg=6PKYu&pd_rd_r=38afa95a-391d-4ad1-ab38-85eea5824137&pd_rd_i=B07T3XDMH8&ref_=pd_bap_d_grid_rp_0_1_ec_pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_d_sccl_2_6_t&th=1)
- **3d printer**: I use 3d prints to house my components.
- **Graphite Paint**: I use graphite paint to make my things conductive, I recommend you electroplate with copper. I just dont have the ability to.
- **Wire Cutters**: Please cut each wire to your prefered length, this will save you much headache.


### **Versions**
- **V1**: V1 was by far the worst out of everything, I thought I could loosley make this without much thought, yet I was severly humbled and was instantly forced to make a new position. It was made out of cut cardboard, aluminum foil, and electrical tape, and prayers.

This is what my V1 [looked](https://github.com/Ingenieria-Olvera/Ionic_Wind_Gen/blob/main/20240912_203514%20(2).jpg) like, and let me tell you it did not work at all.


  
- **V2**: V2 was a bit more refined, using range bits from home depot, electrical tape to hold the transformer wires to the components--WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT DO--and I cut loose triangles that would act as the distribution part.
- **V3**: V3 is my best version, I used a 3d printer along with graphite paint to connect the two and make the two components conductive. I am going to be building apon this with new ideas of more voltage and a more jet engine casing for better performance.
